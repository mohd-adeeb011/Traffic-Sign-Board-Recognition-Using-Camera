# Traffic-Sign-Recognition-Using-Camera

This repository contains a model and training notebook for traffic sign recognition. For inference, youâ€™ll need to clone the YOLOv5 repository by Ultralytics and replace the detect.py file with the one in this repository.

## How to run
Open your IDE or shell in the projects's directory then write python detect.py --weights best_93.pt --source 0
Source 0 is to take input from the webcam.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training is [German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB)](https://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset) containing 43 classes of traffic signs. The training set contains 39209 labeled images and the test set contains 12630 unlabelled images.
